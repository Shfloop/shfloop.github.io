            Developed a graphics overhaul mod for the game Cosmic Reach inspired
            by Minecraft's Optifine and Iris Shaders. The mod adds support for
            runtime swapable shaders and customizable rendering pipelines.

          <p>
            I have always been interested in Minecraft mod development but never
            really knew what to make. I was introduced to Cosmic Reach and
            started learning how to make java mods thanks to the community.
            After a few test mods, I decided to try and create Cosmic Reach's
            version of Iris because it was a way for me to learn OpenGL and get
            a cool result that other people could enjoy too. It took a few
            attempts to get everything working correctly but I managed to make a
            working mod that i am happy with.
          </p>

          <p>
            The mod works around shaderpacks - which are a zip file or folder
            that is placed in the correct directory. The shaderpack then
            contains whichever shaders in the base game you want to replace,
            along with aditional shaders that are specific to the mod, such as
            post processing shaders. It also contains configuration info like
            setting render stage resolution, enabling mip mapping, shadow
            rendering pass, or the details for configuring the shaderpack
            settings
          </p>

              <strong>Configurable Render Pipeline</strong> — Changes what the

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shaderpack Parsing</strong> — Loads a shaderpack folder or
              zip file and formats it to be able to configure the render
              pipeline
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User Interface</strong> — Provides a customizable UI for
              individual shaderpacks which allow packs to define custom settings
              to be applied during render pipeline configuration

              User selects which shader pack they want to use or edit the
              settings of the pack they are using

          <h3 class="h3">What went well</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I learned a lot about engine development, graphics, and java
              modding
            </li>
            <li>I made a mod that works and finished what I set out to do.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">What I’d improve</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Their are many features missing that would make creating
              shaderpacks easier and more enjoyable so if i continue that is
              something that would be needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              I would like to make it a more abstracted pipeline because
              currently its a modification of the base games pipeline resulting
              in massive changes when the games pipeline changes. Making it more
              abstract and reimplimenting the games pipeline would make it a lot
              easier to update along side the game.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">Next steps</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Work on catching back up with the game.</li>
            <li>
              I've got other projects to work on but if there is more interest I
              would continue updating.

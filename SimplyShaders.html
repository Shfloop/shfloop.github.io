          <p>
            I have always been interested in Minecraft mod development but never
            really knew what to make. I was introduced to Cosmic Reach and
            started learning how to make java mods thanks to the community.
            After a few test mods, I decided to try and create Cosmic Reach's
            version of Iris because it was a way for me to learn OpenGL and get
            a cool result that other people could enjoy too. It took a few
            attempts to get everything working correctly but I managed to make a
            working mod that i am happy with.
          </p>

          <p>
            The mod works around shaderpacks - which are a zip file or folder
            that is placed in the correct directory. The shaderpack then
            contains whichever shaders in the base game you want to replace,
            along with aditional shaders that are specific to the mod, such as
            post processing shaders. It also contains configuration info like
            setting render stage resolution, enabling mip mapping, shadow
            rendering pass, or the details for configuring the shaderpack
            settings
          </p>

          <h3>How The Mod Is Used</h3>
          <p>
            The mod is installed by launching the game with the Cosmic Quilt or
            Puzzle Mod loader and appropriate versions. Cosmic Quilt is a fork
            of Minecraft's Quilt mod loader configured to work with Cosmic
            Reach, while Puzzle is a custom mod loader made for Cosmic Reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game starts and plays normally until the user enables custom
            shaders through a custom menu and selecting the shaderpack they want
            to use. Each shaderpack can have a custom configuration menu that
            can define settings and buttons to alter the pack. This allows
            shaderpacks to include lots of different customizability by using
            #IfDef for toggling features, or constants (which are modified by
            the settings menu) to change any value such as changing color tones,
            or increasing a shadow bias.
          </p>
          <h3>How The Mod Works</h3>

          <p>
            The current rendering in Cosmic Reach has a forward rendering
            pipeline, where each stage builds upon the last. Each shader stage
            writes the pixel color to one output buffer overwriting what was
            previously there.
          </p>
          <p>
            This mod converts the rendering pipeline to give shaderpacks the
            ability to choose how it runs. The base games rendering stages still
            happen independently and in a set order but shaderpacks can choose
            what buffer the stage writes too. If a deferred rendering pipeline
            is preferred, a pack can simply provide updated shaders, and define
            buffers for normals, albedo, position. Then for each stage where
            instead of outputting color, the shader can write to the 3 buffers
            and a post processing shader can do the final lighting calculations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each stage can also read from the 8 buffers which creates a
            corruption if the previous rendering stage is writing to the buffer
            the current stage is trying to read from. This mod deals with this
            by using 2 duplicate buffers for each rendering texture. This is a
            achieved by ping-ponging the buffers between shader stages. This
            approach was used by the inspiration for this mod, Minecraft's Iris
            Shaders.

          <h3 class="h3">What went well</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I learned a lot about engine development, graphics, and java
              modding
            </li>
            <li>I made a mod that works and finished what I set out to do.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">What I’d improve</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Their are many features missing that would make creating
              shaderpacks easier and more enjoyable so if i continue that is
              something that would be needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              I would like to make it a more abstracted pipeline because
              currently its a modification of the base games pipeline resulting
              in massive changes when the games pipeline changes. Making it more
              abstract and reimplimenting the games pipeline would make it a lot
              easier to update along side the game.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">Next steps</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Work on catching back up with the game.</li>
            <li>
              I've got other projects to work on but if there is more interest I
              would continue updating.

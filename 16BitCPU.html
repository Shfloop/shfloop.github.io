          <p>
            I had reliability issues with by prevous 8-bit CPU, and wanted to
            make PCB's. Wanting to improve the design I ended up completly
            redesigning the CPU as a 16-bit CPU with a 5-stage pipeline. The
            goal of this project was to try and maximize the capability of the
            CPU, while minimising the chip count. This is most noticible in
            instruction decoding where I was able to keep the different
            instruction formats to 7 with room for expansion if needed
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>5-stage pipeline with data forwarding and hazard resolution</li>
            <li>Improved ALU supporting bit-wise operations</li>
            <li>Up to 16 general purpose registers</li>
            <li>20 MB of banked addressable memory</li>
            <li>Seperated instruction and data memory</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">What went well</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I'm happy with the design of the CPU. I set out to make a
              pipelined CPU but I also wanted to make it as simple as possible
              (keeping chip count low, making decode logic as simple as
              possible)
            </li>
            <li>
              I was able to make a working CPU, although it's not fully complete
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">What I’d improve</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Adding a barrel shifter is the biggest improvement I could see.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding interupts would also improve the design a lot at the cost
              of a lot of circuitry.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">Next steps</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a PCB for the memory stage</li>
            <li>Continue development</li>
          </ul>

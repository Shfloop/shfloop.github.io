      <!-- Overview -->

          <p>
            As a team of 4, we were tasked with creating a web app to run on a
            local vm on campus. We chose to make a mock valorant esports match
            betting app. This app allows a person to log into their account and
            place bets on upcoming matches and see their results history. One
            challenge we found is there isnt a publicly availbale API to receive
            updates for matches. We solved by using web scraping and scheduled
            executer system to efficiently update matches while reducing wasted
            calls to our web scraper. This app handles secure authentication by
            using google sign in with OAuth2.0 and also supports email and
            password login. Authenticated users are then able to place bets, see
            betting histroy, and update profile settings.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- System / Architecture -->
      <section class="box">
        <div class="box-title">System Architecture</div>
        <div class="box-body">
          <p>
            The architecture for our web app started out very simple. Just a
            single node.js express server and another express server running the
            web scraper. We used MySQL as our database and got a simple
            authentication and accounts system set up. I see signing in with ___
            on almost every site i visit and i really wanted to see how it
            worked and if I could add it to our project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went with Google and followed their OAuth 2.0 documentation on
            adding it on the server side. I managed to get it working running on
            local host but i realised after trying to make it work on the
            server, google requires the callback URL to have a public domain
            name and https certificate. If the callback URL doesn't, it just
            doesn't let the user authenticate. This was a problem because our vm
            is located on the campus network and does not have a public IP.
          </p>
          <p>
            After doing some research i figured the best way to add this
            functionality was to use a reverse proxy for the local VM, and use
            reverse SSH to forward the traffic to the local VM. I accomplished
            this by making use of the free trial of Google Cloud Platform i
            signed up for when making my account for the google sign in. I set
            up a Compute Engine VM running linux and NGINX and set it up with a
            free domain name from duckdns.org and a certificate using certbot
            and LetsEncrypt.
          </p>
          <p>
            After doing all this i was curious what a fully cloud based web app
            would look like, and I still had plenty of credits to spend so i
            moved everything to the cloud. Below is a diagram I drew of the
            architecture i came up with that supports the local VM via the
            reverse proxy, and a separate instance of the web app running in the
            cloud.

          <h3 class="h3">What went well</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A learned and did a lot with backend development</li>
            <li>We succesfully built the app we set out to make</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">What I’d improve</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Many design decisions where made because there is no public api
              for esports matches so many systems could be improved with a
              dedicated api over web scraping.
            </li>
            <li>
              I should have built it in Java or Go, Node.js and TypeScript are
              fine but i would have had a better time with something else.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">Next steps</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              None, its a comleted project I also dont support gambling so I
              wouldn't want to continue.
